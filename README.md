## About the Project

The Big Mart Sales Prediction project aims to predict the sales of products at Big Mart stores using historical sales data. The project applies various machine learning algorithms to find the best model for sales forecasting.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize trends and patterns in the data.
- **Model Training**: Implement different machine learning algorithms for sales prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using metrics such as RMSE and R-squared.

## Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Big Mart Sales dataset, which contains information about sales from various stores, including features like:

- Store ID
- Item ID
- Item Type
- Item MRP
- Outlet Size
- Outlet Location Type
- Sales amount

You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bigmart-sales-prediction/data).

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/big-mart-sales-prediction.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd big-mart-sales-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to see the sales prediction results:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook SalesPrediction.ipynb
   ```

## Results

The project includes visualizations of sales trends and model evaluation metrics. The final model's performance is measured, showcasing its effectiveness in predicting sales.
